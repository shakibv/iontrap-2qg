## IonTrap-2QG

## Overview
IonTrap-2QG is a project focused on simulating and analyzing ion-trap quantum gates. The repository contains code and data for the implementation and testing of quantum gates using ion-trap technology.

## Repository Structure
- **data/**: Contains ion-trap parameters used for simulations and the configuration files.
- **include/**: Third-party libraries.
- **src/**: Source code for simulations and analyses.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files to be ignored by git.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler
- Python 3.x
- CMake

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/shakibv/iontrap-2qg.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd iontrap-2qg
    ```
3. Build the project:
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

## Usage
Run the simulations by executing the compiled binaries in the `build` directory. Refer to the specific examples in the `src` folder for guidance on running simulations and analyzing results.
